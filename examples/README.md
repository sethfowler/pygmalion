Here you'll find examples of configuring Pygmalion and integrating it with other
tools.

* `pygmalion.yaml.default` shows all of Pygmalion's configuration options and
  their default values.

* `vimrc.example` shows how to integrate Pygmalion with `vim`. (This will
  eventually get turned into a fully-fledged plugin.)

* `ycm_extra_conf.py.example` shows how to integrate Pygmalion with
  [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe).

* `emacs.el.example` shows how to integrate Pygmalion with `emacs` and
  [irony-mode](https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode). (This will
  also eventually get turned into a fully-fledged plugin.)
